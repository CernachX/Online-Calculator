# Online-Calculator

This project is a Flask-based web application that provides a user-friendly interface for performing various geometric calculations. The application allows users to calculate properties such as area, perimeter, and other dimensions for different shapes, including circles, and triangles (Planned: squares and rectangles, along with more triangle functions). It also includes a basic calculator for evaluating mathematical expressions. This project is ideal for students, educators, and professionals who need quick and accurate geometric calculations. It can also serve as a learning tool for understanding the mathematical properties of shapes.

Features:
Error Handling:Validates user inputs to ensure they are non-negative numbers. Provides meaningful error messages for invalid inputs, such as negative values or invalid syntax.
Dynamic User Interface:Each shape has a dedicated page with an intuitive form for inputting dimensions. Results and error messages are displayed dynamically on the same page.
Backend Logic:Implements mathematical calculations for each shape using Python functions. Ensures safe evaluation of mathematical expressions by sanitizing inputs.
Responsive Design: The application is styled for usability and accessibility, with a clean layout and interactive buttons for navigation.

Planned:
Add support for more complex shapes and calculations (e.g., polygons, ellipses).
Include interactive visualizations for shapes.
